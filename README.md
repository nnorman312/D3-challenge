D3

Using information from the U.S. Census Bureau and D3 techniques, I create an interactive scatter plot that displays health risks of certain demographics by state. I code this graphic in the app.js file and pull in the data from data.csv. The scatter plot includes interchangable variables such as Age (Median) vs. Smokes (%), In Poverty (%) vs. Obesity (%), and Household Income (Median) vs. Lacks Healthcare(%).
